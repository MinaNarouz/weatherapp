# Weather-Journal App Project

## Overview
This project requires you to create an asynchronous web app that uses Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI. 

## Instructions
This will require modifying the `server.js` file and the `website/app.js` file. You can see `index.html` for element references, and once you are finished with the project steps, you can use `style.css` to style your application to customized perfection.

## Extras
If you are interested in testing your code as you go, you can use `tests.js` as a template for writing and running some basic tests for your code.

## Developer comments of project as below:

## Requirements

## Project Notes
This is a educational project that I am testing my knowledge of learning in applying some async functions and http requests.

## Setup
To open this website, review with style and dynamically; steps as follow:
* extract zip file in one main directory.
* Server listening to port 3000
* Write in the URL localhost:3000 to open and test the app.

## js code comments
Are written in a way so that other developers can understand.

## Design comments
All design in CSS, I changed a bit of the appearance and only one design is amended by JS in case user failed to enter the data required.

## IMPORTANT
In order to be able to run the app you will have to have the node module installed on your PC, I did not upload it with the project in GIT because it has big size.
